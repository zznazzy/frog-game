# Frog Game

A browser-based arcade game where you play as a frog catching flies while avoiding bees.

This was originally created as a simple pygame project that I made in Notepad at some ungodly hour during freshman year, this version represents a complete reimagining and expansion of the concept with significantly enhanced gameplay, visuals, and technical implementation.
